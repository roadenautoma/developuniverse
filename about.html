                                    A long time ago, in a place not too far away, as I turned 12 years old, two important events happend:

                                        My school friends realized that there were 3 other Martin's in the class, and therefore, decided to start calling me <strong>"Gonto"</strong>.

                                    <li>
                                        Last but not least, my uncle, a systems engineer, started showing me the magic of programming by teaching me one of the most hated programming languages of all time: <strong>Visual Basic 6</strong>.

                                    At the age of 16, I had already programmed lots of different video games with Visual Basic 6 like Simon Says, Buraco, Truco &amp; Black Jack. I also joined a forum called <strong>Gamesario</strong>, and helped coding parts of a game called Argentum Online, also with VB6.

                                <p>When I reached the age of 18, not only I started to grow a beard,
                                <!-- TODO: How do I add an image of a beard here in the middle?-->
                                 but also I started studying <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> at UTN (National Technology University). Since college was a few hours per day, I was bored afterwards, and I knew how to code, I decided to join <a rel="external" href="https://globant.com/">Globant</a>, one of the biggest software consulting firms in Argentina. At that point, I was coding in C# and did apps for <a rel="external" href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForce</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.ea.com/">Electronic Arts</a> among others. </p>

                                <p>1.5 years later, I started learning about Open Source and was really excited about it. Considering that there weren't too many open source projects around .Net technologies at that time, I decided to start working with Java in Globant. I worked on projects like <a rel="external" href="http://www.playphone.com/">Playphone</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a>.</p>

                                <p>Another 1.5 years later, I decided to switch companies and started to work at <a rel="external" href="http://www.flowics.com/">Zauber (now called Flowics)</a>. It was a software boutique where I knew I could grow a lot and learn lots of different programming languages like Scala, Ruby, Javascript and others. In this 3 years, I became a professional software developer thanks to the help of great mentors like <a href="https://twitter.com/mcortesi5" alt="Mariano Cortesi">Mariano Cortesi</a>. I ended up being a technical project leader, leading teams of up to 5 people.</p>

                                <p>After 3 more years, I felt that it was time to start giving back to the community which helped me learn so many different languages and frameworks. This is when I started doing freelancing and building my own Open Source projects. Looking back, <strong>this is the decision that started changing to course of my carrer, getting my nearer to Marketing.</strong></p>

Some of these prjoects are used nowadays by Fortune 500 companies around the world like <a href="https://weather.com" rel="external">weather.com</a>, <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" rel="external">Disney</a> and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/" rel="external">Reuters</a>.</p>
                                <p>The most interesting part about this is how these projects got to be popular. Even though I didn't know it at that point in time, the answer is <strong>Developer Marketing</strong>. I wrote tons of articles about Restangular and adjacent technologies (like AngularJS and Rest APIs) in my blog, distributed these blog posts on news aggregators (like Hacker News and Reddit) and also sent them to influential people to review and share. I also actively searched and answered questions on both Stackoverflow and Quora related to these projects, and started talking and engaging with other open source developers to bounce of ideas.</p>
                                <p>All of these led me to the <strong>AngularJS Mountain View meetup</strong>, where I did the first talk of my life. As you can see from the video below, I was so nervous that I sounded like a robot. </p>

                                <p>Thankfully, being such a bad speaker on that first meetup didn't bring me down. I started applying to CFPs and got accepted to more than 20 different conferences around the world. You can see a few of the videos from those conferences below.</p>

My job included giving talks in different conferences around FrontEnd technologies, Security, and APIs among other things, as well as writing blog posts, and documentation for the product itself. Last but not least, I was in charge of creating the SDKs for all the different frameworks and languages. Pretty fun job, right?</p>
